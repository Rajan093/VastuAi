2. Sun : Effects and Remedies
The second chapter of Lal Kitab, termed as the wonder Book of Astrology, details
the effects of Sun in various houses alongwith the remedies.
The sun, eulogised by the author of the Lal Kitab as Vishnu, the lord of presentation, is the father of
our solar system, around which all planets resulve. The power of light in the sky, the temperature of
the earth, the power of presentation and progress are represented by the sun. His presence means
the day and absence means the night. The soul in human body and the power of rendering
bodily services to others have also been referred to the Sun - a royal planet of power, authority and
finances.
The Sun provides good results if placed in houses 1 to 5,8,9,11 and 12. The 6th, 7th, and 10th are
bad houses for the Sun. The Moon, the Jupiter and the Mars are the planets friendly to the Sun,
where the Saturn, Venus, Rahu and Ketu are enemies. The first is the Puccka Ghar, the permanent
house and the house of exaltation of the Sun, whereas the 7th house is in the house of debilitation.
The Mars in the 6th and Ketu in the Ist house make the Sun produce results of an exalted planet. If
the Sun is exalted or placed in an auspicious house of a persons horoscope he is bound to rise
higher and higher in power and position. If obstacles are created against him by a person that person
is bound to meet his doom. Much better results are proposed if the Sun is in conjunction with
Mercury.
The Sun gives adverse effects on the things associated with the house in which he is placed. Conse-
quently in the Ist house he will create health problems for the native. In the 2nd house he will affect
the family and its comforts absolutely adversely.
The sun in the 6th house will not prove good for the sisters and daughters of the native. In the 7th he
will face obstacles in the comforts of the wife. The Sun of the 8th house will saue the native from
death in critical situations.
The sun of the 9th house will destroy the comforts of the forefathers and perhaps deprive the native
of their properties. In the 10th, the sun will affect the father adversely. The sun in the 11th increases
and multiplies the income of the native manifold, if he does not augment the power of Saturn by
cosumption of liquor, meat and eggs. The Sun in the 12th house destroys the comforts of the night
hour sleep of the native.
The Sun will not be able to harm Venus when sun is being aspected by Saturn because Saturn and Venus are great
friends. On the contrary, if Saturn is being aspected by Sun, then the Sun will not be afraid of Saturn and he
will destroy the Venus as both are natural enemies in the house where he is placed.
The effects of the Sun in both the situations in different houses are as below :
